# Instajudge

 Judging app for Debate club. Faster than quickjudge.

## How to use in debates

**NB: Neither versions automatically add scores, as this would require them knowing English.**
**This means that you have to input scores where required, and as an added bonus this app works in practically any language**

### Python version

Copy instajudge.py into a new folder, and make a text file called `Debate.judge` in the same space.
Then continue to type the debate in the syntax shown, and you will get the result.

### HTMl version

Go to this page: <https://advait-sen.github.io/Instajudge> for the web version. Currently quite bad.
